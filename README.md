# RoboticsXSUSTech
I've been collecting materials, talking to exprtise (or the experienced) as well as practising in learning robotics myself over the year. Been a senior student, I'm also going to take the responsiblility to provid guides to new member of the robotic club starting from next semaster.

This repository (which may later be expented to a website) is created not only to collect some probablly useful resources, but also record my personal ideas and some interview of other expertise (if possible) of learning robotics. 

Hope this would finally provide help to those in SUSTech who are interested in, but feeling confused and lost in how to learn robotics. 

Instead of being an exprtise, I'm still a naive learner in this field myself. I hasitead for a long time since I think I might not be qaulified enough. However, I determied that it's a right thing to be done and hopefully it might provided more help than harm.
