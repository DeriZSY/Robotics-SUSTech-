# RoboticsXSUSTech
## Original Intro to this project
I've been collecting materials, talking to exprtise (or the experienced) as well as practising in learning robotics myself over the year. Been a senior student, I'm also going to take the responsiblility to provid guides to new member of the robotic club starting from next semaster.

This repository (which may later be expented to a website) is created not only to collect some probablly useful resources, but also record my personal ideas and some interview of other expertise (if possible) of learning robotics. 

Hope this would finally provide help to those in SUSTech who are interested in, but feeling confused and lost in how to learn robotics. 

Instead of being an exprtise, I'm still a naive learner in this field myself. I hasitead for a long time since I think I might not be qaulified enough. However, I determied that it's a right thing to be done and hopefully it might provided more help than harm.

1. The book [SLAM for Dummies](books/SLAM_for_Dummies.pdf) with my own notes is added. 

I used to prepare writing some comments on  Probabilistic Robotics as guidance (since I found it quite confusing sometimes) and use it as a introduction for new comers to this area. Now, I found this book better since Probabilistic Robotics is a acamdeic book and it's not that friendly. Although the a lot of detials are skipped in SLAM for Dummies, I found it useful to at least understand the algorithms how SLAM works and buld up a wheel on oneself instead of simply fooling around with open source packages on ROS directly.

Also, I may just leave this project in fragements until I have enough time to got a road map. Since I'm starting to working as a SDE intern in a company on SLAM, I think this might be a good start.
